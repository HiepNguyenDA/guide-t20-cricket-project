In this guided project, the focus is on analyzing cricket data from the T20 World Cup to select the best 11 players based on various performance metrics to form a competitive cricket team. The project aims to help create a team capable of scoring 180 runs on average and defending 150 runs against alien opponents.

Python and Pandas are used for data cleaning and transformation. This includes loading match results, cleaning data, converting columns, linking tables using match IDs, and exporting the final data into CSV files. The Dim Players.csv file is created, containing player information such as name, team, batting style, bowling style, and player role.

The clean data is then imported into Power BI. Further data transformation is performed using Power Query, including renaming columns, removing unwanted characters, sorting values, and removing duplicates. DAX measures are created for analysis, and relationships between tables are established in the data model.

The dashboard building process is then demonstrated. The instructor guides through designing and constructing a visually appealing and informative dashboard. The dashboard includes multiple pages focusing on different player roles such as power hitters, anchors, finishers, and specialist fast bowlers.

Finally, the project involves analyzing key performance metrics such as batting average, strike rate, boundary percentage, bowling speed, dot balls percentage, and economy rate. These metrics are used to select players for specific roles and form the best 11-player team as requested.
