In this guided project, the project aims to select the best 11 players based on various performance metrics to form a competitive cricket team.
Python and Pandas were used for data cleaning and transformation. tasks include loading match results, cleaning data, and exporting it to CSV files.

After, the clean data was imported into Power BI. Further data transformation was done using Power Query, as well as creating DAX measures for analysis.

Building the dashboard came next. I followed and designed/built a visually appealing dashboard. The dashboard includes various pages focusing on different player roles (e.g., power hitters, anchors, finishers, specialist fast bowlers).

Finally, analyzing performance metrics such as batting average, strike rate, boundary percentage, and bowling performance was done. Then selecting players based on these metrics to form the best 11 players team as requested.

Key Takeaways:
+ The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data collection to visualization.
+ It highlights the use of Python for data cleaning and transformation and Power BI for building interactive dashboards.
